# Iterative Time-Series Modelling with Turing

Install requirements by entering the package manager in a REPL with `]`
```
add package
```
or
```
import Pkg
Pkg.add(package)
```

Minimal requirements to run inference:
```
CSV
DataFrames
Dates
Optim
StatsPlots
Turing
```

You can also instantiate the package specified in `Project.toml` with
```
] instantiate
```

To run interactively, see [IJulia.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) and [jupyter-lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
